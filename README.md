# Terrorism in the world

I worked on this project for my first course in Data Analytics at Coderhouse.
## Description of the project
As part of the project, I analysed a dataset on terrorist attacks perpetrated between 1970 and 2017 all around the world. The dataset contains data on the geography, typology and deadliness of the attacks, as well as the organizations responsible for them.
Based on that data, I built a Power BI dashboard with four main tabs, which are:
* Geography
* Typology
* Organizations
* Targets

Each tab contains cards with essential indicators on the topics as well as graphs showing trends in the data.
The user can use the graphs interactively by applying the filters, such as data, country and area, at the top of the tabs or by clicking directly on the graphs to select a subset of data.

## Files

At the end of the course, I submitted the Power BI dashboard I built as well as a presentation of the project containing information on my methodology and the conclusions I drew from the dashboard.
Both files are available here in Spanish and English.
